# CS220AU Digital Portfolio

## Overview
The goal of this GitHub repository is to serve as my digitial portfolio for the CS220AU module. It demonstrates minimalistic approaches to:

- project management using this `README.md` file, organized under the Overview, Tasks, and Log headings
- web hosting through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- web design with [Markdown language](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- self- and peer-assessment via the `assessment.md` and `checklist.md` files

The URL for the website can be located in the sidebar, under the 'About' section. The homepage content is sourced from the `index.md` file.

### Portfolio Items
My portfolio includes the following components:

1. **website**: explores my research question across my webpage
2. **self- and peer-assessment** (10%): utilizes the `assessment.md` file
3. **portfolio overview** (10%): provides a succinct description of my portfolio, along with a list of tasks to do (Tasks) and those already completed (Log) in this `README.md` file: https://khofstadter.github.io/CS220AU-DP/

## Tasks
Constract an essay (the webpage) around my current research question draft (How AI takes over our lives?):

1. Create a list of keyword;
2. Use these keywords to find literature via search engines (find help at https://navigatingthedigitalworld.com/docs/project-management);
4. Use the litrev findings to help answer my research questions. To do this I will construct an essay framework (title, keywords, introduction, body, conclusion, references). A guide can be found on the portfolio template's website: https://khofstadter.github.io/CS220AU-DP/
5. Finalize all files in this repository
6. Download the checklist file and submit it (only this one) on FASER.
