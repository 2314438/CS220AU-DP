## Self-assessment
Using the marking rubric, I've assessed my own progress: <!-- move the symbols in the table below -->

When I think back on how I evaluated the topic "AI's Inevitable Rise: A Revolution in Personal and Professional Lives Linked to Digital Entities," I see how far I've come in understanding the intricacies and implications of this changing technological landscape. My comprehension of AI's ubiquitous impact on various facets of our existence has expanded as a result of researching its incorporation into both personal and professional domains. I recognise that I have a deeper understanding of how artificial intelligence is influencing wearables, smart homes, and educational resources. Understanding how humans and AI can function together in the workplace is a step towards realising how work environments are changing. This improved comprehension helps me better manage the constantly shifting technological landscape and adjust to the changing demands in both the personal and professional domains. I now have a deeper understanding of the ethical issues surrounding AI as a result of the self-evaluation. In order to emphasise the significance of ethical frameworks in AI deployment, privacy concerns, bias mitigation, and responsible development have arisen as crucial focal points. The commitment to responsibly contribute to the ongoing discussion on ethical AI techniques is strengthened by this realisation. The self-evaluation provides direction for future development. It emphasises how important it is to keep learning new things all the time, keep up with how artificial intelligence is developing, and participate in debates to help shape these technologies in an ethical and responsible way.

The text is very well structured, organized and easy to understand. Also, each item is supported by multiple examples. The text is easy to read with line breaks, but still it is difficult to read. So, my suggestion is you can visit the page of GitHub Docs and use some ways to make the text more readable. For example, make a small title with bold letters, underling of important parts, and put images related to your essay. It may also be possible to put a link in text. If so, it could be made more readable. You could write a summary of the advantages and disadvantages of artificial intelligence (AI). I think it is better to change the title from body to other because this section is your main part of this essay so you can put sentences including what you will mention in this part. Part 2 could be written more depth. It consists only of an explanatory section and doesn’t mention about how to address those things compared to Part 1. It would be better to include solutions to those concerns. Your Readme is very good. It is simple and well organized so I can understand easily what you did through log and tasks. 
Overall, the writing is well structured and good both essays and Readme, but from the point of view of a blog, it lacks a little in easy to read. I think it would be very good if the text were structured using by some methods.
